cowfortune
==========

A random cow that says random cookie fortunes. Cool huh?

Two of the most vital, core software of Debian infrastructure now combined!

A key piece of code that belongs in your heart (and in your ~/.bashrc too).

Inspired by the beloved (and sometimes hated) mint-fortune.


Install
-------

To install, run as root:
make install

To uninstall (also as root):
make uninstall

Installs by default to /usr/local/games
Use --prefix or --bindir to change

Or, if you prefer to build a debian .DEB package:
debuild binary && sudo dpgk --install ../cowfortune*.deb


Requirements
------------

cowfortune requires cowsay and fortune.

To install them in a Debian or debian-like system:
sudo apt-get install cowsay fortune


Usage
-----

No options, no fuss. Simply run:
cowfortune

... and have fun! (hey, it rhymes!)

For the ultimate experience, put it in your ~/.bashrc
Or, even better, Linux Mint style: put in /etc/bashrc


Contributing
------------

Just clone the git repository:
git clone https://github.com/MestreLion/cowfortune.git

and start hacking!

Patches are welcome, especially for items in TODO list.


TODO
----

- Add per-user configuration at ~/.config/cowfortune
	blacklist - do not pick these cows
	whitelist - pick only these cows ('none' to disable cowfortune)
- Add common options like --help and --version
- Add some cowsay and fortune passthrough options
